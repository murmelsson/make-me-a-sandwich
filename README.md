# make-me-a-sandwich
Implements the make-me-a-sandwich joke from https://xkcd.com/149/ for macOS.

Use the file make-me-a-sandwich.sh
  - download/clone/retype the file 
  - make it executable
  - use the example config suggested at the end of the script...
    - to create alias command and 
    - to run it using sudo

      
    [or if you like, use your own config solution, e.g. for bash config]

The demo video shows this script+config solution working.
